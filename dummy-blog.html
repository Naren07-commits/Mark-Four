        <h2> querySelector vs getElementByID </h2>
        <h3>What is querySelector? </h3>
                            QuerySelector is a function that returns an element that matches a CSS query. 
                     Note the querySelector method only returns the first instance of a selector. 
                     When using querySelector , you can specify any CSS selector that you want. 
                     For instance, you could retrieve an element which has a specific ID set, or an element by its tag name. 
                     You can specify multiple selectors using the querySelector and querySelectorAll methods. 
                     To learn more about CSS selectors, check out our guide to CSS and HTML attribute selectors .
                     If matches are not found, null is returned.

      </p>

      <h3>What is getElementById?</h3>
      <p>
The getElementById() method retrieves an element based on its ID attribute, hence the name.
This method is more restrictive than querySelector because you can only retrieve elements based on their particular ID.
You would use this method if you only want to retrieve one element from the web page. This is because HTML IDs must be unique to a particular element. You cannot use an ID to refer to two elements on the web page.

      </p>
      <br/>

      <h3>
        querySelector vs. getElementById

      </h3>
      <p>
The obvious similarity between these two methods is that they both select elements from a web page. They do so in different ways.
With a querySelector statement, you can select an element based on a CSS selector. This means you can select elements by ID, class, or any other type of selector. Using the getElementById method, you can only select an element by its ID.
Generally, you should opt for the selector that most clearly gets the job done.
If you only need to select an element by ID or class, you can use getElementById or getElementsByClassName, respectively. If you need to use a more elaborate rule to select elements, the querySelector method is your best option.
